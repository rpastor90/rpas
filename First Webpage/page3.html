          There are no warnings against the perils of pragmatism. As the youngest of four boys in an immigrant family, making practical choices often took precedence over everything else. Hand-me-downs were constant growing up, and in truth, they never really bothered me. However, it was not often that I could have something that was truly my own.

          In the Golden Age of 2001, when Backstreet Boys were king, WWE was still WWF, and Goku was still fighting Cell: I started my first Xanga account. I finally had a space of my own, and I learned quickly that it was totally customizable. I spent hours, creating and recreating my page. Brooklyn Kid font, Ignition the Remix upon loading, a lot of Dragon Ball Z pictures, and as many eProps as I could get my friends to “hit me back” with. I could talk about how basketball was that day, or I could blogosophize about how inconsiderate it was to only leave one eProp on someone’s post. There obviously wasn’t anything groundbreaking happening on xanga.com/slomo3, but for better or worse, at that time I lived for the moments I could tinker with my site.

          In college, I made the very practical choice of pursuing a career which would yield a decent income. I got into a prestigious pre-law program sponsored by one of the biggest law firms in the world and shortly thereafter, I was accepted into law school on a full scholarship. No matter how I felt about the work, I told myself that the ends justified the means. I had an opportunity to make a decent income and I could potentially do good. The truth is though, that the work made me miserable. Every minute spent reading, writing, rereading, rewriting, and citing felt like an endless chore. However, pragmatism reigned supreme, and I drudged through my first year of law school.

          In the countless hours I spent in a cubicle of the law library, I had a lot of time to consider what I really enjoyed doing. It wasn’t hard to remember my xanga. When I finally finished my first year of law school, I reached out to some programmer friends and asked for advice. They pointed me to codeacademy, a few problems from App Academy, and the book Eloquent Javascript. I figured I’d work with programming stuff in the evenings, after my internship, and it’d be a nice way to pass time. However, I quickly became consumed with programming. After eating dinner, I would start a problem, and 8pm quickly became 3am. For the past few weeks I haven’t slept much, but I’ve been learning a lot. And beyond all expectations I’m having a ton of fun and I am as happy as I’ve been in a very long time. So much of my life has been dictated by pragmatism and a lot of times there’s nothing wrong with that, but I am excited to be stepping out of my comfort zone and pursuing something I’m truly passionate about. Programming.
